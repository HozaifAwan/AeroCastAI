          AeroCastAI was founded with a single mission: to revolutionize severe weather forecasting through the power of artificial intelligence. By leveraging real-time meteorological data, we strive to provide early warnings, minimize property damage, and ultimately save lives. Our vision is simple yet ambitious: to predict the unpredictable â€” and protect lives, one forecast at a time.
